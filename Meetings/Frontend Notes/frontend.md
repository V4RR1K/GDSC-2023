## Front End: UX (Interaction) & UI (Design)
- Ios App Development (Why? Maps on websites are ugly)

### UX 
- User accounts? Will the entry page be a log in or just a welcome page?
- Search bar: Users interact with this to find the exact lcoation they're looking for 
- Map (Local/ Long distance): Background/ center of application.
- Bookmark/ Saved Locations/ Favorites: Users may mark certain locations that will be stored here for quick access.
- Travel Mode/ Type: Users may select the way they're navigating for accurate navigation times. The options are: Car, Bicycle, Bus, Metro (or Airplane? Suggestions needed! )



## UI
- Here's the link to the figma I made, I've added you all as viewers only but I think you can still click on the frames and see what the actions I've given for each tab/button.

- I've also sent you all an invite to this figma to your rit emails!


## Logo Idea 
- Ignore my really bad artistic skills... Focus on the potential!!
- The basic idea is for it to be a big green R (for recycle... duh) and the for the top of the R to be open (like a lid) like kind of what the logo for recycling in (the little green open bin with the little pieces of trash going inside) and then there would be an extension from the bottom of the R that reaches the opening and is a little hand throwing out the pieces of trash!
- Let me know if you have an artistic critique!!!!!!!!
